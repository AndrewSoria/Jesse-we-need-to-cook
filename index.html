    <b>Jesse Jackson: An Activist, a Baptist, and a Presidential Candidate</b></h1> 
  
  <h2>By:Andrew Soria</h2>
      <br>
    <br>
     
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h5> Jesse Louis Jackson is an American political activist, Baptist minister, and politician. He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 and served as a shadow U.S. senator for the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1997.</h5> 
        <h1 >Beginning</h1>
          <h5>Jesse adopted the name of his stepfather, Charles Jackson, at about age 15. A good student in high school, Jesse was elected class president and later attended the University of Illinois (1959–60) on a football scholarship. He then transferred to the predominantly Black Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina in Greensboro and received a B.A. in sociology (1964). He moved to Chicago in 1966, did graduate work at the Chicago Theological Seminary, and was ordained a Baptist minister in 1968.



While an undergraduate, Jackson became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1965 he went to Selma, Alabama, to march with Martin Luther King, Jr., and became a worker in King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Jackson helped found the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket, the economic arm of the SCLC, in 1966 and served as the organization’s national director from 1967 to 1971. </h5>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h1>Controversy and problems</h1>
           <h5> He was in Memphis, Tennessee, with King when the civil rights leader was assassinated on April 4, 1968, though his exact location at the moment King was shot has long been a matter of controversy. Accused of using the SCLC for personal gain, Jackson was suspended by the organization, whereupon he formally resigned in 1971 and founded Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity), a Chicago-based organization in which he advocated Black self-help and achieved a broad audience for his liberal views. In 1984 he established the National Rainbow Coalition, which sought equal rights for African Americans, women, and homosexuals. These two organizations merged in 1996 to form the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</h5>
<h1>Jackson's Travels</h1>
    <h5>Jackson began traveling widely in the late 1970s to mediate or spotlight international problems and disputes. In 1979 he visited South Africa, where he spoke out against apartheid, and he later journeyed to the strife-ridden Middle East and campaigned to give Palestinians their own state. While some observers and government officials frowned on his diplomatic missions as meddlesome and self-aggrandizing, Jackson nonetheless won praise for negotiating the release of U.S. soldiers and civilians around the world, including in Syria (1984), Iraq (1990), and Yugoslavia (1999).</h5> 
        <h1>Jackson's Political Life</h1> 
        <h5>In the 1980s Jackson became a leading national spokesman and advocate for African Americans. His voter-registration drive was a key factor in the election of Chicago’s first African American mayor, Harold Washington, in April 1983. The following year Jackson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination. During the campaign he drew criticism for his relationship with Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam and for making a disparaging remark about New York’s Jewish community; Jackson later apologized for his comments and distanced himself from Farrakhan. In what was then the strongest showing ever by an African American candidate, Jackson placed third in the primary voting. In 1988 he staged another bid for the Democratic nomination and came in second to the party’s eventual nominee, Michael Dukakis. Jackson’s increasing influence within the Democratic Party ensured that African American issues were an important part of the party’s platform. Jackson, a dynamic orator, made memorable speeches at later Democratic conventions but declined to run again for the presidency.

In 1989 Jackson took residency in Washington, D.C., and in 1990, when the Washington City Council created two unpaid offices of “statehood senator”—popularly called “shadow senator”—to lobby the U.S. Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia, Jackson won election to one of the posts, his first elective office. In 1997 President Bill Clinton named him a special envoy to Africa, where he traveled to promote human rights and democracy. That year Jackson also founded the Wall Street Project, which sought to increase minority opportunities in corporate America.During the impeachment hearings against Clinton in 1998, Jackson counseled the president, and in 2000 Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That year Jackson also received a Master of Divinity degree from the Chicago Theological Seminary. The following year, however, he became embroiled in controversy when it was revealed that he had fathered a child out of wedlock. Jackson continued his social activism, giving lectures and leading protests. He also remained involved in politics, notably endorsing various candidates. His books include Straight from the Heart (1987; ed. by Roger D. Hatch and Frank E. Watkins) and Legal Lynching: Racism, Injustice, and the Death Penalty (1995). In 2017 Jackson revealed that he had Parkinson disease. Four years later he was hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 and subsequently spent several weeks in a rehabilitation facility.</h5>

            >Conclusion</h1> 
        <h4> In conclusion, Jesse Jackson lived a life fighting for what he believed in. Not only did he march alongside Martin Luther King Jr, but he also started several civil rights organizations and he was even nominated to be one of the first black presidents. Even though he was not the first black president, he made such a large impact on the world that it wouldnt be the same without him. This is why he is such an important figure in Black history month. </h4>
